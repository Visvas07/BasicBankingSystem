        <h1>About the Bank</h1>
        <p class="desc">Gringotts Wizarding Bank was the only wizarding bank in Great Britain, and was owned and operated by goblins. It was founded by a goblin named Gringott in 1474. Its main offices were located around the North Side of Diagon Alley in London, England. In addition to storing money and valuables for wizards and witches, one could go there to exchange Muggle money for wizarding money, which appeared to not be very difficult, as shown when Hermione Granger's parents did so while paying for her school supplies. The currency exchanged by Muggles was later returned to circulation in the Muggle world by goblins. According to Rubeus Hagrid, other than Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Gringotts was the safest place in the wizarding world.The motto of Gringotts Wizarding Bank was <q><b>Fortius Quo Fidelius</b></q>, a Latin phrase that meant <q><b>Strength through loyalty</b></q>. The bank also had its own bureau de change, issued cheques and bank notes, had a specific form for client bank transactions, and its own mail system.

        <p class="desc">Gringotts was an imposing snow-white multistoried marble building located partway down Diagon Alley, near its intersection with Knockturn Alley, that towered over the neighbouring shops. It was the place where British witches and wizards stored their money and other valuables, in heavily-guarded vaults miles below ground. When Harry Potter first visited Gringotts, he was told by Hagrid that one would have to be mad to try to rob Gringotts and that, apart from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, it was the safest place for anything valuable to be kept. Goblins were extremely greedy and would protect their money and valuables at any cost, which made them ideal guardians for the valuables of the wizarding world. The goblins had a code that forbade them to speak of the bank's secrets, and would consider it "base treachery" to break any part of that code.</p>

        <p class="desc">Wizarding currency was the currency used by the wizarding world. Wizards were not averse to using currency with convoluted denominations, because they were easily able to solve complex calculations with magic. Wizarding currencies varied from country to country. The wizarding currency of Great Britain consisted of three different coins; in decreasing order of value, they were: Galleon, Sickle, and Knut. They were gold, silver, and bronze, respectively. There were 17 Sickles in a Galleon, and 29 Knuts in a Sickle, meaning there were 493 Knuts in a Galleon. Around the edge of each coin was a series of numerals which represented a serial number belonging to the Goblin that cast the coin</p>
